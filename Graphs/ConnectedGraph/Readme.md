Chapter 28: Graphs and Applications, Exercise 28.1

Write a program that reads a graph from a file (directed by a URL) and determines whether the graph is connected. The first line in the file contains a number that indicates the number of vertices (n). The vertices are labeled as 0, 1, . . . , nâˆ’1. Each subsequent line, with the format u v1 v2 ..., describes edges (u, v1), (u, v2), and so on.
