From An Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming with Java, 5e by Thomas Wu

Chapter 12: File Input and Output, Exercise 14, p. 726

"Write a program that reads a text file and converts its content to an Eggy-Peggy text (i.e. placing egg in front of every vowel of a string). Save the converted text to another text file. Use JFileChooser to let the user specify the input and output files (I used JavaFx, so that'd be FileChooser). Create the input file by using a text editor."
