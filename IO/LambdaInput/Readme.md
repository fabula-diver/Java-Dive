An Input class that inputs simple data type values, using the following methods:

public static String readLine() reads in an entire line as a string.
public static char readChar() reads in a single character.
public static double readDouble() reads in a double value.
public static float readFloat() reads in a float value.
public static long readLong() reads in a long value.
public static int readInt() reads in an int value.

For each method, if the input value does not conform to that methodâ€™s type, print an error message and terminate the program.
